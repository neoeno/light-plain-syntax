# A Light Plain (No-)Syntax theme

![Screenshot](https://github.com/neoeno/light-plain-syntax/raw/2332ba715179a2c120ea596a0bea102c666df285/screenshot.png)

A theme that removes most syntax highlighting, with a couple exceptions:

* String literals
* Comments
* Erroneous syntax

## Why

And why would you bother to do this? Two reasons I can see:

1. You read [this article](http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/syntaxhighlighting/) and thought it seemed interesting
2. You want to gain an edge in the pairing process by making your set-up as esoteric as possible

## Who

Largely a port of the VS Code [Plain Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gerred.theme-plain). Thanks to [@gerred](https://github.com/gerred) for that!

## Contributing

Have I missed a very important bit of syntax that needs highlighting? Feel free to submit a PR!

Note that obviously the spirit of the theme is fairly minimal so I probably won't merge any significant new additions to the highlighting.
